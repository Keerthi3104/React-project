# 🫧 Bubble Sort Visualizer (React)

This project is a frontend-based Bubble Sort Visualizer built using React.  
It visually demonstrates how the Bubble Sort algorithm works step-by-step with animated bars and color indications.

## 🧠 Bubble Sort Explanation

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
With each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position at the end of the array.

This continues until the entire array becomes sorted.

## 🖥️ How the Visualizer Works

1. User generates a random array.
2. The array is displayed as vertical bars.
3. When sorting starts:
   - Bars being compared turn 🔴 red.
   - Swapped bars animate smoothly.
   - Sorted elements are marked 🟢 green.
4. The process continues until the array is completely sorted.
